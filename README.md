# core-plug-detector
This github repository is created as a supplementary resource to my Master's thesis conducted during the spring of 2020. The focus of the project was to fine-tune a Faster R-CNN object detection model using the Tensorflow API in order to detect CCA and non-CCA core plugs in optical core images. 

The data used to train and evaluate the various models, and the pipeline configuration files can be found in the [data](data) directory
